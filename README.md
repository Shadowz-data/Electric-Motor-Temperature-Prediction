The detailed explanation to this project can be found in "Motor Temperature.ppsx" file.

The project is deployed using Flask.
To run the Resultant Webpage i.e "home.html" and "csv.html" file present in the template folder one has to run the python terminal and run the "app.py" for "home.html" and "web.py" for "csv.html" programs. (All the files have to be in a single directory for the program to run correctly)

Once the "Code.ipnyb" is run, a file "test_predictions.csv" is created. It contains the resulant predicions of the test set that is uploaded to the kaggke competition page.
